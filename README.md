# HuntCareer - Job Aggregator Project

## Overview

This project is a Job Aggregator application designed to help users find and apply for jobs. It consists of a separate frontend application and a backend API.

- **Frontend:** Provides the user interface for searching jobs, user registration/login, and viewing job details.
- **Backend:** Offers API endpoints for managing job listings, user authentication, and other core functionalities.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `frontend/`: Contains the React-based frontend application.
- `backend/`: Contains the Node.js and Express-based backend API.

Each of these directories has its own detailed `README.md` file with specific setup, installation, and execution instructions. Please refer to them for more information.

## Navigation and Setup

1.  **Backend Setup:**
    - Navigate to the `backend/` directory.
    - Follow the instructions in `backend/README.md`.

2.  **Frontend Setup:**
    - Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
    - Follow the instructions in `frontend/README.md`.

## Core Technologies

-   **Frontend:**
    -   React
    -   React Router
    -   Tailwind CSS
    -   `react-toastify` (for notifications)
-   **Backend:**
    -   Node.js
    -   Express.js
    -   MongoDB (with Mongoose or a similar ODM implied by typical Node.js setups)
    -   JWT (for authentication)
    -   bcryptjs (for password hashing)
    -   CORS

## General Workflow

1.  Ensure your MongoDB instance is running or accessible.
2.  Start the backend server (from the `backend/` directory).
3.  Start the frontend development server (from the `frontend/` directory).
4.  Access the application through the frontend URL (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

Please see the README files within the `frontend` and `backend` directories for more detailed instructions.
