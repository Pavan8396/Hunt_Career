    This commit provides the definitive fixes for all outstanding issues.
    
    - **Chat Persistence**: The chat system now correctly persists conversations across sessions. Messages are saved to the database and loaded when a chat is opened. A race condition that prevented history from loading after a re-login has been resolved by making the `ChatContext`'s connection logic more robust and dependent on the authentication state.
    - **User Icon Menu**: The inconsistency in the employer's user icon menu has been fixed by removing redundant links.
    - **Applied Jobs Page**: This commit also re-implements the 'Applied Jobs' page, which was lost in a previous reset.

    fix: Ensure chat history loads correctly after re-login
    
    This commit fixes a bug where the chat history would fail to load after a user logged out and logged back in without a full page refresh.
    
    The root cause was a race condition where the `ChatContext` was not properly reacting to changes in the authentication token from the `AuthContext`.
    
    The fix involves:
    - Updating `ChatContext` to explicitly depend on the `token` from `AuthContext`.
    - Ensuring the socket connection is re-established with the new token on login.
    - Using the token from the context for API calls instead of reading directly from `sessionStorage`.
    
    This makes the chat system's state management more robust and ensures it always has the correct authentication details.

    fix: Implement full chat persistence
    
    This commit implements true persistence for the chat feature by saving messages to the database.
    
    The key changes include:
    - The backend socket server now saves every chat message to a `chats` collection in MongoDB.
    - A new API endpoint (`GET /api/chat/:roomId`) has been added to fetch the chat history for a given conversation.
    - The frontend `ChatContext` now calls this endpoint when a chat is opened, populating the chat window with the full conversation history.
    
    This ensures that chat conversations are no longer lost on page refresh or logout/login, providing a complete and robust chat experience.

    fix: Overhaul chat system for persistence and two-way communication
    
    This commit completely refactors the chat system to address several critical bugs and improve user experience.
    
    The key changes include:
    - A new global `ChatContext` now manages the socket connection and all chat state, ensuring that conversations persist across page navigation.
    - The dedicated chat page has been replaced with a persistent, floating `Chatbox` component available on all pages.
    - The new `Chatbox` includes a close button and closes automatically on outside clicks.
    - The bug causing a logout error has been resolved by properly managing the socket lifecycle within the new context.
    - Chat initiation is now correctly implemented for both job seekers (from the job details page) and employers (from the applications list on the posted jobs page), enabling two-way communication.
    - The old, non-functional chat component and its route have been removed.

    feat: Implement persistent chat system
    
    This commit refactors the chat functionality to be more robust and user-friendly. It addresses three issues from the original request:
    - The logout error on the chat screen.
    - The lack of chat conversation persistence.
    - The poor chatbox close behavior.
    
    This has been achieved by:
    - Creating a global `ChatContext` to manage the socket connection and chat state, ensuring conversations persist across page navigation and the socket lifecycle is handled correctly.
    - Replacing the old page-based chat with a new, persistent `Chatbox` component that floats on all pages.
    - The new `Chatbox` component includes a close button and closes automatically when the user clicks outside of it.
    - The old `ChatPage.jsx` file has been removed to avoid code duplication and confusion.

    This commit introduces the 'Applied Jobs' page, allowing job seekers to view a list of jobs they have applied for.
    
    This is a full-stack implementation that includes:
    - A new backend API endpoint (`GET /api/user/applied-jobs`) to fetch the applied jobs for the authenticated user.
    - A new frontend page component (`AppliedJobs.jsx`) that calls this endpoint and displays the jobs.
    - Integration of the new page into the application's routing and navigation, with links in the user dropdown menu.

    feat: Implement multiple features and bugfixes
    
    This commit addresses several issues and adds new features to the job portal application.
    
    - **Applied Jobs Page**: Implemented a new 'Applied Jobs' page for job seekers to view jobs they have applied to. This includes a new route, a page component, and a link in the navbar.
    - **Logout Error Fix**: Fixed a concurrent rendering error that occurred when a job seeker tried to log out from the chat screen. The issue was resolved by properly managing the socket.io connection lifecycle.
    - **Dashboard Improvements**: Enhanced the employer dashboard with new features, including charts for applications over time and job postings by type, and a list of recent applications.
    - **User Icon Menu Fix**: Removed redundant 'Dashboard' and 'Post A Job' links from the employer's user icon menu to improve UI consistency.
    - **Chat Persistence**: Implemented chat conversation persistence using a global `ChatContext`. Conversations now persist across page navigation.
    - **Chatbox Close Behavior**: Improved the chatbox close behavior by adding a close button and allowing the chatbox to close automatically when the user clicks outside of it.

    feat: Implement multiple features and bug fixes
    
    This commit includes the following changes as requested by the user:
    
    1.  **Fix Logout Error from Chat Screen:**
        -   Refactored the chat components (`Chat.jsx`, `ChatPage.jsx`) to use `useRef` for the socket instance. This prevents the socket from being re-initialized on re-renders and fixes the concurrent rendering error on logout.
    
    2.  **Improve 'Shortlisted Candidates' Page:**
        -   Refactored the 'Shortlisted Candidates' page to group candidates by job posting.
        -   The backend now uses an aggregation pipeline to return the candidates grouped by job.
        -   The frontend has been updated to display the data in the new grouped format.
    
    3.  **Create 'Applied Jobs' Page:**
        -   Implemented a new page where users can see all the jobs they have applied for.
        -   This includes a new backend endpoint and a new frontend page.
    
    4.  **Enhance Employer Dashboard:**
        -   Redesigned the employer dashboard to include graphs.
        -   Added two new backend endpoints to provide stats data for the graphs.
        -   The dashboard now displays a bar chart of applications over time and a pie chart of job postings by type.
    
    This commit also includes several other improvements and bug fixes that were identified during development, including:
    -   Fixing the "Users" collection name issue.
    -   Fixing the JWT `type` vs. `userType` inconsistency.
    -   Fixing the `deleteJob` functionality.
    -   Adding a comprehensive test suite for the backend.

    Fix: Explicitly set 'Users' collection name in userModel
    
    This commit fixes a bug where the application was writing to a new, incorrect `users` collection instead of the existing `Users` collection. This was caused by Mongoose defaulting to a pluralized and lowercased collection name.
    
    The fix explicitly sets the collection name to 'Users' in the `userModel.js` file, ensuring that all user data is stored and retrieved from the correct collection.

    feat: Separate Shortlist and Chat buttons and add Shortlisted Candidates page
    
    This commit implements the following changes:
    - The "Shortlist" and "Chat" buttons on the Posted Jobs page are now separate. The "Chat" button is always visible, and the "Shortlist" button is only visible for non-shortlisted candidates.
    - A new page has been added for employers to view all their shortlisted candidates in one place.
    - A new backend endpoint has been created to support this new page.

    Fix: Prevent state update on unmounted chat component
    
    This commit fixes a React rendering error that occurred when a user logged out from the chat screen. The error was caused by a state update being called on an unmounted component.
    
    The fix introduces a ref to track the mounted state of the chat component and prevents the state from being updated if the component is unmounted. This resolves the race condition and prevents the error.

    Fix: Resolve view applicants bug and access regression
    
    This commit addresses several issues:
    - Fixes a bug that prevented employers from seeing job applicants. This was caused by an inconsistent collection name for users and an issue with the `populate` function. The user model now explicitly sets the collection name to 'Users', and the `populate` call in `applicationController.js` now explicitly specifies the model.
    - Fixes a regression that prevented employers from accessing their own job postings. This was caused by an inconsistency in the JWT payload. The JWT payload for both users and employers now uses `userType`.
    - Improves the `deleteJob` functionality to also remove the job from the employer's `postedJobs` array.
    - Adds a comprehensive test suite to verify the fixes and prevent future regressions.

    Fix: Correct JWT payload for employer login
    
    A previous commit introduced a regression that prevented employers from accessing their own job postings. This was due to an inconsistency between the JWT payload generated at login and the check performed in the `isEmployer` middleware.
    
    This commit fixes the regression by changing the JWT payload to use `userType: 'employer'` instead of `type: 'employer'`, aligning it with the middleware.
