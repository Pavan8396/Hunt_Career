# Performance Testing Framework

This directory contains the performance testing framework for the application, built using Apache JMeter. The framework is designed to simulate realistic user loads and identify performance bottlenecks before they impact production.

## Directory Structure

- `test-plans/`: Contains the JMeter test plan (`.jmx`) files.
- `test-data/`: Contains CSV files with test data for data-driven testing.
- `scripts/`: Contains shell scripts for automating test execution.
- `reports/`: Contains the generated HTML performance test reports.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in the `PERFORMANCE_TESTING_GUIDE.md` to set up your environment and run the performance tests.
